# Neverest-NON-CONTACT-SWITCH
Workplan,review,bill of materials,designes,schematics,code and complete implementation of the contactless switch.

## PROJECT STATEMENT
The need for safe health practices such as using sanitizers after using public amenities like taps,doors or switches is very essential to reduce  spread of COVID-19. Therefore there is an immediate need in the innovation involving touch free triggers to facilitate actions such as activating taps, doors and switches.

### COMPONENTS
-Arduino Mega 2650
-HC-SRO4 Ultrasonic sensor
-Photocell
-Led
-10K and 220 ohm resistors
-Jumper wires
-Breadboard

## SPECIFICATIONS
### HC-SRO4 Ultrasonic sensor
Working Voltage: DC 5V, Working Current: 15mA, Working Frequency: 40Hz, Min Range: 2cm, Max Range: 4m, Measuring Angle: 15°.

### Photocell
Photocell is ½” diameter CdS (cadmium-sulfide). Universal 120-277 AC voltage (50-60Hz) is standard. Preset 3 to 10 second time-delay prevents unintended switching due to momentary flashes of light. Power consumption: 2 watts.
